# Property_Price_Prediction
The purpose of this project is to illustrate the use of R programming to solve a historical problem Property Price Prediction aka House Price Prediction. In this project , we'll focus more on the Descriptive Analysis and Visualization and less on the Predictive Analysis. The idea is to push students at Imarticus to go through a rigorous Data Exploration and Visualization before employing any ML model on it. In the latter part we'll use the most basic and frequently used approach for this kind of Business problem i.e. Linear Regression .
